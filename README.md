# CopyUtil

## About

A seriously small script which allows client-side clipboard copying.  
There is no server-to-client event - this tool is intended for local commands.

## Usage

In client-side lua:

```lua
exports.copyutil:Copy('text')
```

Note: if you change the resource name, the exports name will be changed to!
